# LDAP:
An LDAP report is about Active Directory state, such as user accounts, groups, and organizational units.
It can only be about the current state of Active Directory, not historical changes.
It is typically used to query information that can be retrieved using LDAP queries.
For example, it can be used to find all users in a specific group or to retrieve the attributes of a specific user.

LDAP queries can be short or long. Here are a few examples of LDAP queries:
Find all objects with objectClass = user: (&(objectClass=user))
Find user objects whose login name is jdoe: (&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=jdoe))
Return all group objects: (objectClass=group)
Return users where the disabled flag is NOT set: (&(objectClass=user)(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)))
Return users who belong to the Admins group: (&(objectClass=user)(memberOf=CN=Admins,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com))
